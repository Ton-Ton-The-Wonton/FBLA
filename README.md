# Partners Portal

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application that allows the schoolâ€™s Career and Technical Education Department to manage their business and community partners. The application is built using Bootstrap, jQuery, Flask, SQLite, OpenAI, and Streamlit. The application has four main pages: List, Add, Report, and Chatbot. The List page displays a list of partners with the ability to filter, the Add page allows users to add a new partner, the Report page displays a report of the partners by category, and the Chatbot page allows users to interact with a LLM-backed chatbot.
